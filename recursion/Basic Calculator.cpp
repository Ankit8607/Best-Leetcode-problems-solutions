/*

Given a string s representing a valid expression, implement a basic calculator to evaluate it, and return the result of the evaluation.

Note: You are not allowed to use any built-in function which evaluates strings as mathematical expressions, such as eval().

 

Example 1:

Input: s = "1 + 1"
Output: 2
Example 2:

Input: s = " 2-1 + 2 "
Output: 3
Example 3:

Input: s = "(1+(4+5+2)-3)+(6+8)"
Output: 23
 

Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 3 * 105
s consists of digits, '+', '-', '(', ')', and ' '.
s represents a valid expression.
'+' is not used as a unary operation (i.e., "+1" and "+(2 + 3)" is invalid).
'-' could be used as a unary operation (i.e., "-1" and "-(2 + 3)" is valid).
There will be no two consecutive operators in the input.
Every number and running calculation will fit in a signed 32-bit integer.

            }
            else {
                rst += sign * num;
                num = 0;

                }
                if (c == ')' && ops.size()) {
                    rst = ops.top() * rst + nums.top();
                    ops.pop(); nums.pop();
                }
            }
        }
        rst += sign * num;
